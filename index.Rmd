## About me


I'm Khadija Mhiri, a statistical and data analyst engineer. I  study at the [*Ecole Supérieure de la Statistique et de l'Analyse de l'Information*](http://www.essai.rnu.tn/accueil.htm)  several mathematical and data science courses: econometrics , time series , probability , data mining, financial engineering and Computing tools for Statistics such as `R` and `Python`. 

I’m especially interested in Machine Learning, Quantitative Analysis and Financial Markets.   For my work, I use every day `R`. I will be sharing, in this website, some `R` and `Python` codes where I show how you can use these softwares to solve Machine Learning, Quantitative Analysis and trading problems. Your feedback, comments and questions are very welcome. 

You will also find here  my CV and some projects in `R` and `Python` . 

 

So feel free to [contact me](mailto:khadija.mhiri95@gmail.com)
